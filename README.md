ðŸŒ¾ Prediction of Agriculture Crop Production in India

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting agricultural crop production trends in India using historical data (2001â€“2014) sourced from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/). The goal is to gain actionable insights through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling to support decision-making in agricultural planning.

âœ… Data cleaning: standardizing column names, handling missing values  
âœ… Filtered crop production records from broader dataset  
âœ… Reshaped wide-format data (year columns) into long-format for time-series analysis  
âœ… Visualizations:
  - Top 10 crops by total production
  - Year-wise production trends
